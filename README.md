## üß† Model Architectures

### 1. Length of Stay Prediction Model
```python
Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)
])
```
- Uses Huber loss for robustness against outliers
- Optimized with Adam optimizer (lr=0.001)
- Dropout layers for preventing overfitting

### 2. Admission Prediction Model
```python
Sequential([
    Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(7, 8)),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Bidirectional(LSTM(32, return_sequences=True)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Bidirectional(LSTM(16)),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```
- Hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for temporal pattern recognition
- Bidirectional LSTM layers for capturing complex dependencies
- Binary cross-entropy loss function

### 3. Resource Forecasting Models
- **XGBoost Regressor** for occupancy prediction
  - Parameters: max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100
- **ARIMA Models** for time series forecasting
- **Random Forest & Gradient Boosting** for resource optimization
